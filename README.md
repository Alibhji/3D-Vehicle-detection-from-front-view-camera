There are two general ideas:
 - **Detect Center point of each object (x, y in image) then regress its properties (X, Y, Z, Roll, Yaw, Pitch in 3Dworld)**\
 - First the masks will be generated by using the center point of each object from annotation (Ground Truth) as you can see in following pictures:\
 - center poitns:\

- imags and coresponding generated masks:\
